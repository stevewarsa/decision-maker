Make your decisions methodically based on weighted decision factors which you rate.
Let's say you have to decide between 3 job offers (who wouldn't love that problem!). Here's how you use it:

1. Enter the company name in the option name box.
2. Enter the critical factors you will use to evaluate the job offer. Up to 7 are allowed.
3. As you are entering each factor, decide on how important that factor is to you and select a value from the drop down list (1-5: 5 is most important, 1 is least important)
4. Also, as you are entering each factor, rate the current option on that factor. As you rate each factor, the total rating at the bottom of the screen for the current option will automatically change. You can also manually press calculate to update the total rating.
5. When done entering the factors, weights and ratings for one job offer, press the right arrow next to the Option Name box to create a new option. Everything but the option name and ratings will transfer over to the new option. Enter the name of the new option, then rate it against the same factors you rated the previous option against.
6. Repeat the process for the 3rd job offer. Note - if you want to, you can go back and view the previously entered ratings by pressing the left arrow
7. To see all the ratings just use the left and right arrows to go back and forth. Note - once you leave the application, all options and ratings are cleared (Nothing is permanently saved).
